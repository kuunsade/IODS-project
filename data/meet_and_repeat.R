# Both datasets have two categorical variables (which we'll convert them to in a minute): BPRS has treatment and subject
# RATS has ID and Group. Both have longitudal data from different time points in their own columns. With BPRS, the weekly median
# goes down with time, but RATS is the opposite: the median values go up.

# Both datasets now have 5 columns, but BPRSL has 360 rows (previously 40) and RATSL has 176 rows (previously 16). The previous dataset rows
# correspond to each research subject and the columns indicated information on said research subject. It's the same with long form.
# BUT! Now we have gathered the longitudal data into multiple rows, so each subject has "repeats" after a certain point.
# This hopefully makes it easier to analyse and visualise in furhter steps.
