# Chapter 1 - Warmup
## Feelings and expectations

I'm quite excited to participate in this course. I've already used _R_ and _R Markdown_ before but I know my way of coding is not efficient or clean. This is why I expect to learn better methods to use _R_, _R Markdown_ and other tools introduced during the next month or so.

My PhD supervisor told me about this course because she thought I could greatly benefit from this.
